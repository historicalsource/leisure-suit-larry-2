										=================



Reminder:  be sure to update your \system subdirectory, if necessary.  


	1. First, rebuild all the system files:

			cd \system
			redo			which redirects output to \ll2\script
				this requires:
					SC.exe
					redo.lst		with the names of all the system *.sc files



	2. Then, rebuild all the Larry2 stuff:

			cd \ll2
			redo			also redirects output to \ll2\script
				this requires:  
					TM.com 		to time the make (just for fun; unnecessary), 
					VC.bat which calls: 
					\system\vc 	(the vocab compiler), and then
									copies the output to \ll2\script
					SC.exe
					INCVER.exe 	which needs the file \ll2\version 



	3. Then, build the resource.* files for 360s and 720s:

			cd vols
			make360		to make just 360K resource.*
			make720		to make just 720K resource.*
			makeall		to make both 360K and 720K resource.*
				these require:
					TM (for fun)
					makevols



	4. Finally, copy the resource.*, .exe, and .bat files to floppies:

			copy360 		to make just 360K disks
			copy720		to make just 720K disks
			copyall		makes 360K disks, then makes 720K disks
			copyboth		makes 360K disks interleaved with 720K disks (fastest 
								since it copies one size while you change other size.
								BE CAREFUL, as it's easy to copy over another disk
								while you are busy sleeping with boredom!)
				these require:
					makevols.exe  \
					sciv.exe       \
					install.exe 	 >	in \system
					drvcopy.bat    /
					*.drv	        /
		
					exists.com     \
					godir.com       > in \system
					space.com      /         
		
		
					lsl2.bat       \  in \ll2\vols   
					instgame.bat   /     


					__insth.bat			different files in both 360 and 720 subdirs


					Volabel 				somewhere in path
